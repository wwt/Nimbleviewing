### Welcome to Nimbleviewing, the repo with surprisingly little in it

If you're applying for an Android development position at World Wide Technology Application Services then this is the repo for you!

### Instructions
Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to show album titles and images in a Recycler view. The album title and images should be retrieved from [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/). The project already contains a base URL (the one above!) and endpoint URLs for this task.

BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS:
- Remove all occurances of the letter "e" (case-insensitive) from album titles

You are free to change *anything* about the current code so long as you accomplish this goal. Make it read and function the way you want it to, but bear in mind we’re looking for people who understand what best industry practices look like in Kotlin.

NOTE: The code in its current state does not compile, _that's on purpose:_ on a real-world project you might need to pick up code from another member of your team and continue from where they left off, and they may not have completed their thought.

### FAQ (click to expand):
<details>
  <summary>Q:  What if I want to use 3rd party libraries?</summary>

  A: Do it! You can change **anything** about the current code so long as you accomplish the overall goal, show the album titles, and images, in a scrolling list.  If there's a library that will help you get the job done, use it!  Android apps are frequently built using a wide variety of open-source libraries.

  <summary>Q:  JsonPlaceholder is not working, what do I do?</summary>

  A: It only serves up static data, it's probably working, double check. If for some reason the service really did go down use a different one like: 
  - [gorest the other fake API that looks exactly like JsonPlaceholder](https://gorest.co.in/)
  - [reqres the fake API](https://reqres.in/)
  - [the marvel comics API](https://developer.marvel.com/)
  - Literally anything that returns images as URLs in a JSON object
  - Wiremock or a similar library that fakes JSON responses

  <summary>Q:  This was built with a different version of Android Studio than I use, what do I do?</summary>

  A: Feel free to copy the files into a different version of Android Studio, that's completely fine. However we do ask you don't use such an outdated version of the IDE that we'll have a hard time building your project.

<details>
  <summary>Q:  What if I want to go above and beyond?</summary>

  A: There'll be plenty of time in later interviews to showcase your skills, don't worry about it right now.

<details>
    <summary>But I really, really want to</summary>

    A: You can change ***ANYTHING*** about the codebase so long as you accomplish the overall goal. Seriously though, we give you plenty of opportunity to showcase your great engineering skills later on.
